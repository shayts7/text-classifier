# text-classifier
NLP Python code to train and predict labels according to text features


- *Prerequisites:* anaconda + langdetect (conda install -c conda-forge langdetect)
- I followed [a great blog post] (https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-nlp-text-classification-using-scikit-learn-python-and-nltk-c52b92a7c73a) about text classification that used sickit-learn and nltk
- Playing around with the data to find the right approach can be found in the attached jupyter notebook: [trailPython.ipynb] (./trailPython.ipynb) (including information about accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score)
- The actual code (including usage example), can be found in the attached: [textClassifier.py] (./textClassifier.py)
